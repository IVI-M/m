I know that it`s sad but true
I know that you even won`t find out
How much,
how sincerely I love you

It's only in fairy tales
The things happen as you wish them to
But in real life it's not the same
The beast
never finds a girl like you.
  
A girl like you.

Oh, o-oh. Oh..

Of course, somewhere long ago
I was naive and young.
I read a lot of happy sort of
stories about love.
But I grew older, things grew tougher
and I saw some years after
that it`ll never be like there,
it`ll never be the same.
It`ll never be the same
as in those old kind fairy tales

But I can't do this, and it's true

All I can
is to pray
that the sun-rays
would melt smile
at her face
smile at her face
smile
at her face.


Once she was flower of white
Now she is fading away
Shadow of a pain in her eyes
She becomes weaker each day.

And I don't know what's going go on
How to stop it and what is wrong
I'm torn apart
when I think of her tender heart
All my efforts will be in vain
They will just aggravate her pain
So I go
and I pray
that the sun-rays
would melt smile
at her face
smile at her face
smile
at her face.

Life would lose then all its sense for me.

A peace of mind or restless sleepless nights?

When you hold my hand in your hand 
No you didn't understand 
What you did - you've broken my heart 

    When you looked in my eyes 
    Talking to me so softly 
    And you could not disguise 
    What a feeling you brought to me 
    I realized in the moment - 
    I caught by your love 

On a lazy afternoon 
I confessed to you that I love you 
And you told me that you love me too 
And you knew that this was just the start 

And the sky was so blue 
And the grass was so soft and 
the words "I love you" 
where spoken and spoken 
as we plunged ourselves in the depth
of the abyss of our love. 

On a lazy afternoon 
You where in my heart and in my legs (hands) 
And I did not notice when 
You vanished in the heat of summer day 

I was all by myself 
in a total confusion 
What was it? Was it real? 
Or it was my illusion? 
I was there all alone, bare naked 
with my broken heart.

To kiss her, to hug her and make some love.

    Common, and take her! 
    Of course, be kind, polite, considerate, respect her. 
    she may know it yet 
    but She'll learn it later 
    And maybe then she will remember this day through all her life! 

And the same is with guys, they're all much the same, 
Nobody would like him be the one to blame 
That he feels so sad, he feels so alone 
When he is just standing all on his own 

    So, do not waste your time 
    Just come to him and smile 
    And you will see how fast how gently you can change his mind
